# HTML Basics

This repository includes my beginner-level HTML projects as I learn frontend development step by step. Each folder contains a small project focused on different HTML concepts like layout, forms, tables, and navigation.

Projects are built using only HTML and basic CSS, without JavaScript. More advanced projects (CSS, JavaScript, React) will be in separate repositories.
